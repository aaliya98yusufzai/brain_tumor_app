# 🧠 Brain Tumor MRI Classifier

A Streamlit web application that classifies brain MRI images into one of four categories:
- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **No Tumor**
- **Pituitary**

This project uses a deep learning model (CNN) trained on a dataset of brain MRI images to support fast, accurate medical diagnosis.
